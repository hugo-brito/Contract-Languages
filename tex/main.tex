%from memoir documentation:
%TeX tries very hard to keep text lines justified while keeping the interword spacing as constant as possible, but sometimes fails and complains about an overfull hbox.
%The default mode for LaTeX typesetting is \fussy where the (variation of) interword spacing in justified text is kept to a minimum. Following the \sloppy declaration there may be a much looser setting of justified text.
%Additionally the class provides the \midsloppy declaration which allows a setting somewhere between \fussy and \sloppy.
%fewer overfull lines than \fussy, and fewer obvious large interword spacing than with \sloppy.
%the memoir manual also uses \midsloppy!
